# webpack-intro

In this session we learned about web-pack and the benefits of task runners. We also went through and built a sample web-pack configuration which will be used as a starting template moving forward.

## Topics Covered

- We also learned about packag.json and package-lock.json
- ESLint using AirBnB Lint Styles
- SASS files (Just a brief mention as this is a future topic)
- Structure of the package.json (Dev Dependencies and Production Dependencies)
- Basic NPM commands for managing packages
- Basics of .gitignore

## How to run this project

- Clone the Repo
- Browse to the directory and type `npm install`
- Windows Users will need to install win-node-env globally or as optional dependency to the project
  - `npm install -g win-node-env`
  - `npm install --save-optional win-node-env`
- `npm start` will run the dev server locally.
